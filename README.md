# -6Companies30days
I am starting this challenge with arsh
I am glad to announce that I have finally completed all the milestones of the #6Companies30Days Challenge 2023, organized by Arsh Goyal Sir.
This challenge helped me maintain/improve my consistency in coding and gave me very good set of questions to practice and helped me learning various new concepts and methods.
This challenge also helped me in understating the way/type of questions that a particular company generally ask in their assessment.
